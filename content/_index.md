Hello I am Sokol.
I work as a Database Administrator for [Quipu Processing Center](https://www.quipu.de/productsservices/card-payment-services/), a company focused in payments industry based in Frankfurt, Germany.

Previously I have worked as a DBA for [IPKO](https://www.ipko.com/), which is a telecommunications company that operates in Kosovo.

Mostly I work with Oracle products, primarily with their RDBMS. Also I have experience with DataGuard, Oracle Real Application Clusters and of course PL/SQL.

Besides my main work, I like to explore Python programming language as a hobby. I like Python because of its clean syntax and simplicity as well as its large corpus of libraries. For this reason I am focusing myself more towards learning data processing libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

The posts on this blog are mainly in Albanian.
